1) Create an account on github (an online storage space for Git based repositories)
2) Create a new visual studio project (select console application so that it sets up the startup file automatically - need to it to compile).
3) I believe when i right clicked on "Solution 'btree_consol_app' (the name i gave thi sproject) in the SOlutions explorer, i had the option to add this thing to GitHub.
4) I believe now the revision control is working.
5) In solution Explorer - need to click Switch Views buttons once to toggle folder, solution views. Once in SOlution view , only there can compile/add source files etc. 
But that's not all. Laos once in SOlution (not folder view), need to click on this filter icon and click it/arrow to get all files from solution.
6) TO submit changes - need to Click on Git -> Commit. Then on Git -> Push.
7) TO view revision history on GitHub, click on file and then Blame and hten can get history and more.
8) In visual studoo Click Git -> Pull to get changes done by other - me changing on github.com for isntance.
